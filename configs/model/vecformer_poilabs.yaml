# VecFormer model config for Poilabs fine-tuning
# made by EFCK
#
# Identical to vecformer.yaml except ignore_label is set to the Poilabs preset:
# classes absent in Poilabs data are excluded from evaluation metrics (PQ, mIoU, F1)
# during training. The model still trains on all classes present in the data.
#
# To use: pass --model_args_path configs/model/vecformer_poilabs.yaml to launch.py
#
# ignore_label class indices (0-indexed):
#   35 = background (always ignored)
#    3 = folding door
#    5 = rolling door
#    7 = bay window
#    8 = blind window
#    9 = opening symbol
#   11 = bed
#   14 = TV cabinet
#   15 = Wardrobe
#   17 = gas stove
#   19 = refrigerator
#   20 = airconditioner
#   21 = bath
#   22 = bath tub
#   23 = washing machine
